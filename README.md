*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **PHP:**  Version 8.1 or higher
*   **Composer:**  Latest version
*   **Node.js:** Version 16 or higher
*   **npm:** Latest version (Comes with Node.js)
*   **MySQL:** Version 5.7 or higher (or equivalent database system configured for Laravel)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd project-analytics-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install Laravel dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Configure the database:**

    *   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    *   Edit the `.env` file and configure your database connection settings:

        ```env
        DB_CONNECTION=mysql
        DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
        DB_PORT=3306
        DB_DATABASE=project_analytics
        DB_USERNAME=your_username
        DB_PASSWORD=your_password
        ```

4.  **Generate application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations and seeders:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

6.  **Install React dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Development Setup

1.  **Start the Laravel development server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    php artisan serve
    ```

    This will typically start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Start the React development server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

    This will typically start the server at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Configure API URL in React:**

    In your `frontend` directory, edit the `.env` file (create one if it doesn't exist) and set the API URL:

    ```env
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
    ```

## Usage Examples

1.  **Access the dashboard:**

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the address where your React development server is running).

2.  **Login:**

    Use the credentials provided in the seeders or create a new user.

3.  **Explore the dashboards:**

    Navigate through the different dashboards to view project analytics data.  Customize the dashboards to display specific KPIs.

4.  **Interact with charts and graphs:**

    Use the interactive features of the charts and graphs to drill down into specific data points.

## API Documentation Structure

The backend API is designed using RESTful principles and follows a standard structure.

*   **Base URL:**  `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` (or as configured in your `.env` file)
*   **Authentication:**  API routes are protected using Laravel Sanctum. You'll need to obtain an API token after logging in to access protected endpoints.

**Example Endpoints:**

*   `GET /api/projects`:  Retrieve a list of projects.
*   `GET /api/projects/{project}`: Retrieve a specific project.
*   `GET /api/projects/{project}/metrics`: Retrieve metrics for a specific project.
*   `POST /api/projects`: Create a new project.
*   `PUT /api/projects/{project}`: Update an existing project.
*   `DELETE /api/projects/{project}`: Delete a project.

**Data Format:**

The API accepts and returns data in JSON format.  Request bodies should be properly formatted JSON objects. Response bodies will contain JSON objects representing the requested data, along with appropriate HTTP status codes. Detailed API documentation can be generated using tools like OpenAPI (Swagger) which will be implemented in the future.
